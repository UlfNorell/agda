tt != ff of type Bool
when checking that the expression
refl {x = ap {A = Bool→cBool} (λ f → f tt) p} has type
ap (λ f → f tt) p ≡ ap (λ f → f ff) p
Issue2480false.agda:29,1-13
Cannot eliminate type _33 with pattern tt (did you supply too many
arguments?)
when checking that the clause swap tt = ff has type Bool→cBool
